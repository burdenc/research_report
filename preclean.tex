This report evaluates two distinct methods of improving the performance of GPU memory systems. Over the past semester, our research has focused on applying the Hawkeye cache replacement policy on GPUs and exploring headroom of preemptively writing back dirty cache lines.
%In the interest of time and convenience, this report will cover both Hawkeye and precleaning despite each idea being fairly distinct and lacking overlap in implementation.

Our first goal is to reduce L1 and L2 GPU cache miss rates by implementing the Hawkeye cache replacement policy. Hawkeye calculates the optimal cache replacement policy on previous cache accesses in order to train its predictor for future caching decisions. While we show promising performance improvements with Hawkeye, only a select few GPU benchmarks are sensitive to the performance of the cache. From our experiments, we show that Hawkeye, on average, gives an IPC improvement of 3.57\% and 0.56\% over Least Recently Used (LRU) when applied to the L1 and L2 caches respectively.

%Reinforcement learning requires constant input from an oracle to determine if its predictions are performing well. By using OPTGen, an online, delayed calculation of optimal cache replacement, Hawkeye attempts to learn when cache lines have a high chance of reuse. 

We also introduce the idea of precleaning, an alternative to write-back or write-through caching that aims to spread out write bandwidth. Committing L2 writes to main memory when memory congestion is low can hide or lower the performance impact of said write. The idea of precleaning shows promise, but evaluating precleaning fully requires more research in GPU access patterns and prediction techniques.

% with as few as zero chapters (by commenting out the include statements).
% This allows quicker processing by the Makediss command file in case you

% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own

%Craig William McCluskey

%Dr. William R. McCluskey and Lucilla W. McCluskey.  He received the Bachelor
%of Science degree in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology
%and was commissioned an Officer in the United States Air Force in 1971.
%He entered active duty in October, 1971, and was stationed in Denver, Colorado,

%He separated from the USAF in 1975 and worked as an engineer for several small

%to work for Hewlett-Packard in 1979. He left Hewlett-Packard in 1989 and joined
%a small company based in Herndon, Virginia, working out of his house as a
