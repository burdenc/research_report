\chapter{Conclusion}

In this research report we evaluated the cache replacement policy Hawkeye on GPUs and provided coarse headroom for the idea of precleaning. We believe both of these ideas can provide benefits to GPU performance, but current implementations are fairly situational and require the code being run to be sensitive to caching performance and bandwidth usage. We conclude that Hawkeye will provide the most benefit when applied at the L1 cache with just PC as the feature for OPTgen. However, from our performance impact experiments, we believe there's more room for improvement especially with the L2 cache replacement policy. Furthermore, our idea of precleaning requires more sophisticated predictors and metrics before it can be fully evaluated, and we are unsure if this effort is worth the small increases in performance indicated by our headroom study.
